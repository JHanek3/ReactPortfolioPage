# React Portfolio-Page
https://hanekreact.herokuapp.com/

## Explanation

This is the repo for all of my React projects. Right now there are 6 of them with other being hosted at http://hanekpro.com/projects.html. The projects are ToDo List, Quote Generator, Chat App, Star Wars API, Weather Widget, and Blog App. (Totally forgot about pulling the others over.)

If you want to find my non-react repos, they are titled NodeProjects and VuePortfolioPage

##  Future Projects
Out of Laziness, all of my project links going forward will be found https://hanekvue.herokuapp.com/projects like my Node backend work. I did this because I prefer Vuex syntax over Redux sytax.
